The goal of this project was to show that the obvious default topologies for
clustering in two dimensions (square, torus, surface of a sphere) have superior
alternatives. This has been clearly demonstrated.

Circle is superior to square but still so awful that it shouldn't be seriously
considered. Having hard boundaries on your space is just bad.

Torus is inferior to to both a Twisted Torus and a Klein Bottle. Unlike
everything else Klein Bottle isn't homogeneous and its mathematical
justification isn't obvious, so it's probably best to consider Twisted Torus
the serious alternative.

Spherical Surface is clearly inferior to Projective Plane. In any project which
is currently using a Spherical Surface you should try switching. It will almost
always produce a small improvement in behavior for very little computational
cost.

In two dimensions comparing a Twisted Torus and Projective Plane doesn't have a
clear winner. For any given project trying both and comparing is be a good idea.

For larger numbers of dimensions Twisted Torus has a number of drawbacks: It
isn't obvious how to generalize it to larger numbers of dimensions, the naive
approach of trying all possible wraparounds to determine distance slows down
exponentially with the number of dimensions, and it's overall more complex. For
these reasons it's probably best to default to Projective Plane if you're using
more than two dimensions.

A reasonably straightforward higher dimensional generalization of Twisted Torus
is that for each dimension number its length is the height of a tetrahedron in
that number of dimensions and when it wraps around it twists (adds one the
length to half to) all the lower dimension numbers. But this suite doesn't
benchmark that concept.
