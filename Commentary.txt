This project implements different topologies for clustering points.

For most applications you should use Sphere or its much less common relative 
Projective Sphere. The choice of which boils down to a simple question: Is 
points having exact opposites an expected property of the data which you're 
using? If the answer is yes you should use a Sphere. If not you should use a 
Projective Sphere. In practice people use Sphere much too often because they 
don't know about the alternative.

The number of dimensions to use depends heavily on the data you're working 
with. Making the number of dimensions too high will result in overfitting. 
Too low will result in not pulling out much information.

The Twisted Torus is a special case which acts a bit like a Projective Sphere 
with dimensions between 2 and 3. It is especially useful for doing image 
visualizations. Higher dimensional variants on it could be made based 
on lattice packings. Doing that well is an interesting problem.

People intuitively assume that hypercubes are useful for discovering 
parameters but that doesn't pan out in practice. A hypercube looks like a 
spiky ball, especially as the number of dimensions goes up. Popular things 
wind up in the center and unpopular things get shoved into random corners.
